**C# Notes**

**Value types**
Store actual data directly. Typically stored in the stack (RAM). 
Include int, float, long, double, char, bool, decimal, struct, enum.
Can be stored in heap if part of reference type.

**Reference Type**
Reference type is variable which instead of storeing the value in memory directly stores the memory location of actual data.
Reference type are string, array, class etc
